# Development

Development for pcytominer-transform takes place using Python environments managed by [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/).

Documentation is provided through [MyST (or Markedly Structured Text)](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) markdown documents are transformed into docsite content using Sphinx.
Documentation content assumes a "one sentence per line" style.
